long_name: Load/Store Pair for RV32 (Zilsd & Zclsd)
description: |
  This extension introduces load and store pair instructions for RV32,
  significantly improving static code density and performance.

  It defines two sets of instructions:

  - **Zilsd** (32-bit encoding): Provides `ld` and `sd` instructions for doubleword loads and stores.
  - **Zclsd** (16-bit encoding): Provides compressed instructions (`c.ldsp`, `c.sdsp`, `c.ld`, and `c.sd`)
    for both stack-pointer based and register-based load/store pairs.

  These instructions operate on even/odd register pairs (as defined by the Zdinx extension)
  and assume proper alignment for efficient memory access.
