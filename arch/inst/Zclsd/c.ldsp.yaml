long_name: Stack-pointer based load doublewoxd to even/odd register pair
description: |
  Loads stack-pointer relative 64-bit value into registers xd and xd+1. It computes its effective
  address by adding the zero-extended offset, scaled by 8, to the stack pointer, sp. It expands to ld
  xd, offset(sp). C.LDSP is only valid when xdâ‰ x0; the code points with xd=x0 are reserved.
