long_name: Stack-pointer based store doubleword from even/odd register pair
description: |
  Stores a stack-pointer relative 64-bit value from registers rs2 and rs2+1. It computes an effective
  address by adding the zero-extended offset, scaled by 8, to the stack pointer, sp. It expands to sd
  `sd rs2, offset(sp)`.
