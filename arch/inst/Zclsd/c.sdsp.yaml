long_name: Stack-pointer based store doublewoxd from even/odd register pair
description: |
  Stores a stack-pointer relative 64-bit value from registers xs2 and xs2+1. It computes an effective
  address by adding the zero-extended offset, scaled by 8, to the stack pointer, sp. It expands to sd
  `sd xs2, offset(sp)`.
