description: |
  The vsscratch register is a VSXLEN-bit read/write register that is VS-modeâ€™s version of
  supervisor register sscratch. When V=1, vsscratch substitutes for the usual sscratch,
  so instructions that normally read or modify sscratch actually access vsscratch instead.
  The contents of vsscratch never directly affect the behavior of the machine.
